## Task Report
completion status- partialy compelete
pagefour is not being rendered.
pagethree item selected are not being highlighed.
Mobile view of the page three is not compeleted.

### The challenge
page4-is not being rendered because the props which is present in DragDrop.js cannot sent to MainComponets.js ,where the MainComponets.js routes to the pagefour via router dom.
page3- due time contraints ,the selected item is not being hightlighted because no form control mechanism,or can be implemented is reducer.
mobile view: react-dnd cannot be used properly in mobile view

## My process
brute force the basic structure of the application.
use as many nodemodule as posible.
### Built with
- reat-dnd
- react-dnd-html5-backend
- react-transtion-group
- react-router-dom
- reactstrap
- Bootstrap
- bootstrap-social
- font-awesome
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Learn how to brute force project within a given timeframe.
how to manage time so that each task can be compelted.
how to dived a give project to its components and make use of it later for easy build.

### Continued development

mobile view is not implemented,so futher editing of code is required for mobile view.


### Useful resources

- [React-DND](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) - This helped me for draging item from the list and droping it into another section. I really liked this package and will use it going forward.
